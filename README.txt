As a Japanese learner, I want to be able to quickly look up translations of English words to help with my studies. I want to be able to type an English word into an input box and press the translate button, and see the translation displayed next to it. Some additional specifications are that capitalization shouldn't matter, and if the given word is not in the dictionary, it should indicate that.
